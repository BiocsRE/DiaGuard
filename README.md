# Leak Source Code Protection 

## üìù Description

This repository contains an example of a software protection mechanism that **was not developed by me** and is a "leak." The purpose of this project is **educational**, to demonstrate how certain protection mechanisms work in software, even though in this case, the protection is ineffective or poorly implemented.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

- **I do not support or distribute the original software.**
- This software was not created by me, and the protection shown is an example of **how not to implement software protections**.
- The code in this repository has been **analyzed** and **compiled** for educational purposes, showing the vulnerabilities that can exist in software with weak protections.

## üõ† What‚Äôs in this repository?

1. **Protection code** - A small part of code showing how a protection was attempted for the software.
2. **How it works** - An analysis that explains the protection mechanism and its weaknesses.
3. **How to bypass it** - A theoretical demonstration of how this protection can easily be circumvented if someone is inclined to do so.

## üö® Legal Disclaimer

- **This project is for educational purposes only.**
- Sharing protected software without the copyright holder's permission is **only legal in certain contexts** (e.g., under open-source licenses or for educational/research purposes).
- I take no responsibility for any misuse of this code or its applications.

## üìÑ How does the protection work?

The original software was designed with a **rudimentary protection** to try and prevent manipulation or copying of the program. However, the protection used is weak and can be easily bypassed. In this repository, we explore:

1. **The protection algorithm** - A breakdown of how the protection is implemented.
2. **Weaknesses** - An explanation of why this protection fails.
3. **Bypassing methods** - A theoretical guide on how one might bypass this protection mechanism.

## üí¨ Conclusion

This project serves to demonstrate **how weak protection mechanisms** can be easily bypassed, and aims to teach how to improve software security in general. While the protection shown here is ineffective, it is useful for understanding **common pitfalls** in software security.
